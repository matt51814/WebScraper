# WebScraper

## What we want
A webscraper that is able to get sports data, daily and update a database.

I was using Scrapy but for premier league data it is way easier to just query an API.


Need to figure out if I want to update existing data in the DB on ingestion or add new data to the collection in the DB.

It would be good to track different trends by adding new data in the DB but might have to produce a timestamp to ingest with in order to differentiate the JSON.
